Undead Servants
They have the Zombie stat block, and will fight under your mental command.
If they successfully land a killing blow on an enemy and eat the corpse, it will gain 1 hit die and 1 point to one attribute score.
It will then need two final blows and eat the corpses, gaining the same as above.
Once it has 5 Hit Die, we will have it go under a metamorphosis.
In Metamorphosis it loses the 5 hit die and gains a level in sidekick or a new ability.
