to activevate this it must be a corpse that was killed by you with your bloodthirts ability,
?-or a corpse killed by you then you must preform a 1 hour long ritual(not during long rest or short rest)

Undead Servants
can have a max 2
They have the Zombie stat block, and will fight under your mental command.
If they successfully land a killing blow on an enemy and eat the corpse, it will gain 1 hit die and 1 point to one attribute score.
It will then need two final blows and eat the corpses, gaining the same as above.
Once it has 5 Hit Die, we will have it go under a metamorphosis.
In Metamorphosis it loses the 5 hit die and gains a level in sidekick or a new ability, and then it resets the corpse count back.
if the Zombie is Destroyed then you must fully restart restart the Servant
?-If you have atleast 2/3 of the body you can spend 1 hour(or use a spell slot for 1 minute)to put the 
?-infused lifeform back into the body to revive it but it losses all progress to next metamorphosis and lose 1 metamorphosis
